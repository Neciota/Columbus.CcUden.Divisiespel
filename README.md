# Columbus.CcUden.Divisiespel
From 2025 onwards, the divison-based championship replaces the club trophy for the [Concours Commissie Uden](https://www.ccuden.com/).
This project is intended to fetch flight results from the [CompuClub](https://www.compuclub.nu/uitslag/index.php) and calculate the championship standings.

## Points
Each owner scores once for each pigeon in the prize results of a flight, up to a maximum of five points.
Additionally, they score a point for at least one of their top two ranked pigeons appearing in the prize results.
